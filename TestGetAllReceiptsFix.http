# Receipt Scanner API - Test GetAllReceipts Fix
# This file tests the fixed GetAllReceipts endpoint

# Test 1: Get all receipts (should no longer throw null reference exception)
GET https://localhost:5001/api/receipts
Content-Type: application/json

###

# Test 2: Get specific receipt by ID (example - replace with actual ID)
GET https://localhost:5001/api/receipts/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
Content-Type: application/json

###

# Test 3: Get receipts by date range (example)
GET https://localhost:5001/api/receipts/date-range?startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-12-31
Content-Type: application/json

###

# Expected behavior:
# - GetAllReceipts should now return an array of receipts without null reference errors
# - Each receipt should have a valid Merchant object (or "Unknown Merchant" if null)
# - Items array should be properly populated (or empty array if null)
