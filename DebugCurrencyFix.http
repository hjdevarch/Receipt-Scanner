### Debug Currency Detection with Azure Document Intelligence Response

# Step 1: Check current receipts to see currency values
GET http://localhost:5091/api/receipts
Accept: application/json

###

# This will help us see what currency values are being returned
# Expected: When you upload a UK receipt, it should now show:
# - "currency": "GBP" 
# - "currencySymbol": "Â£"
# Instead of the previous incorrect USD values

# The fix ensures that when Azure returns:
# "CountryRegion": {
#   "type": "countryRegion", 
#   "valueCountryRegion": "GBR",
#   "confidence": 0.995
# }
# 
# The application now properly extracts "GBR" and maps it to "GBP"

###

# If you want to test with a new receipt upload:
# POST http://localhost:5091/api/receipts/upload
# Content-Type: multipart/form-data
# 
# receiptImage: [select your UK receipt file]

# The logs will now show detailed information about CountryRegion field extraction
# Look for these log messages when uploading:
# - "CountryRegion field found - Type: ..."
# - "AsCountryRegion() returned: ..."  
# - "Extracted currency from CountryRegion: GBR -> GBP"
